description: "Ryo Currency is a privacy coin based on a proof-of-work consensus
  mechanism. It is similar to other privacy coins like Monero (XMR) or Z-Cash
  (ZEC), since it is actually a fork of Monero. Ryo aims to be a privacy-focused
  cryptocurrency that can be easily used by average users. Its high privacy
  setting makes Ryo suitable for all high confidential transactions as well as
  for storage of value without being traced, monitored or identified. To achieve
  this goal, it focuses on several key areas: Developing and maintaining the Ryo
  wallets; Working with payment gateways to make Ryo widely accepted among
  merchants; Improving coin security, untraceability, privacy and speed;
  Spreading awareness about Ryo."
