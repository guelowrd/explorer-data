  - title: Oasis Foundation Approves Rehide Grant for Secure Web3 Data Management
    description: "The Oasis Foundation is thrilled to announce that Rehide, a
      non-custodial, web3 password manager offering zero-knowledge encryption,
      has been approved as a grant recipient to expand its decentralized and
      non-custodial password management services. In late January, the Oasis
      Foundation completed a $20,000 grant for Rehide, and the team is already
      beginning work on their objectives. With this collaboration comes access
      for all of Web3 to Rehideâ€™s revolutionary password manager integrated with
      Oasis Sapphire for encrypted notes and password storage. "
