      coin you want to deposit     Send to the deposit address     Enable
      swapping for each of the pairs that you wish to let WizardSwap 🧙‍♂️ use
      your coins for    For instance, say you deposited XMR and want to earn

      WizardSwap with 0 fee, by simply only enabling swapping in one direction
      and let other users make the trades to move your liquidity from one coin
      to the other 🥳  🧙‍♂️ The magic isn't limited to just Bitcoin and Monero
