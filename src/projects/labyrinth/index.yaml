  Labyrinth is a multi-chain privacy platform that enables shielded (private)
  accounts on EVM chains, allowing users to conduct private transactions for all
  DeFi activities, such as transfers, swaps, staking, yield farming, lending,
  batch transactions for payroll, and token vesting, while ensuring compliance
  without KYC.


  Its plug-and-play SDK allows developers to easily integrate privacy into their
  dApps without the complexity of cryptography or ZKPs. Labyrinth ecosystem app
  offers a seamless experience for large and mid-volume users, as well as retail
  participants.


  Labyrinth empowers traders, whales, DAOs, and retail users to maintain control
  over their privacy with a compliance network built on selective disclosure and
  decentralized trust.
