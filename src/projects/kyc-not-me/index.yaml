  Cryptocurrencies were created to revolutionize the way we pay for goods and
  services, aiming to eliminate reliance on centralized entities such as banks
  and governments that control our economy.


  Exchanges that enforce KYC (Know Your Customer) operate similarly to
  traditional banks. Users are required to provide identification, such as a
  photo of their ID, to use these exchanges. Moreover, most of these exchanges
  are centralized, meaning that users do not own their keys. In short, this
  implies that the cryptocurrencies belong to the exchange and not the user.
  These requirements go against the decentralized and self-sovereign nature of
  cryptocurrencies.


  With KYCNOT.ME, I hope to provide people with trustworthy alternatives for
  buying, exchanging, trading, and using cryptocurrencies without having to
  disclose their identity, thus preserving the right to privacy. I want to help
  preserve the original ethos of cryptocurrencies.
