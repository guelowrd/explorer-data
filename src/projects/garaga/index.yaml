  State-of-the-art Elliptic Curve tooling and SNARKS verification for Cairo &
  Starknet.

  Garaga enables efficient elliptic curve operations on Starknet. It achieves
  state of the art performance by

    - using a dedicated builtin made by Starkware for emulated modular arithmetic
    - using a suite of non-deterministic techniques for extension field multiplication, pairings, and multi scalar multiplication to reduce the number of steps to verify results.

  Garaga currently supports:

    - Scalar & Multi-scalar multiplication for any Weirstrass curve, including BN254, BLS12_381, SECP256/R1, and ED25519. You can add the one you need by specifying the curve parameters.
    - Pairing operations for BN254 and BLS12_381.
    - Groth16 smart contract verifiers generators for BN254 and BLS12_381.
    - Noir smart contract verifiers generators for ultra keccak honk flavour.
