description: >-
  Umbra is a stealth address protocol for Ethereum for private payments. That
  means it allows a payer to send funds to a fresh non-interactively generated
  address. That address is generated by payer, controlled by the intended
  receiver, but only the payer and the receiver know that.


  The project and Scopelift team are de facto the authors of the stealth
  addresses ERC standards.
