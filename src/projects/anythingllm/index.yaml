  AnythingLLM is an open-source, private, chat with your documents AI chatbot
  that enables your business to unlock more of its potential by having all of
  your written documents made available via a chat-like interface. SOPs,
  Reports, Audits, and more all now become a simple Q&A session instead of
  pouring over hundreds of documents trying to find the right detail.
