  PrivID is an open-source protocol for cryptographically verified identity,
  starting with integration into the AT Protocol and Bluesky. 


  Built with privacy at its core, PrivID allows users to confirm that an account
  is backed by a real human identity without exposing personal data, using
  zero-knowledge proofs via Holonym. 


  PrivID focuses on cryptographic trust, ensuring identity confidence without
  centralized data collection or invasive tracking systems.
