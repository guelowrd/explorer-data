  - title: Namada Mainnet Launch
    description: "The networkâ€™s mainnet rollout began at 3 Dec 2024 15:00 UTC, and
      shortly after Namada started successfully producing its very first blocks.
      The launch of Namada mainnet marks a new era for data protection in the
      blockchain space, a major win for the mission to give users the freedom to
      control their own personal data. "
