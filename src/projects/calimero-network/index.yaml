  - title: SDK Launch
    description: The Calimero SDK empowers you to create Self-Sovereign Applications
      (SSApps) that can operate privately off-chain and settle on-chain. Whether
      you’re working within the NEAR Protocol , Starknet , or soon Dfinity 's
      ICP ecosystems, our SDK enables you to build privacy-first SSApps that are
      accessible across the entire Calimero Network.
