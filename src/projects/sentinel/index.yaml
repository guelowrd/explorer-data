description: Sentinel is a mobile ‘watch only’ wallet that allows you to track
  the balances and transactions of your offline, cold storage or just about any
  of your bitcoin wallets. Sentinel tracks all types of addresses or extended
  public keys and can also generate new addresses to enable you to receive
  bitcoin into your offline wallets on the move. Sentinel never has access to
  your private keys, so never has the power to spend your funds. You can however
  pass Sentinel a pre-signed hex formatted transaction from a device that holds
  your private keys and then use Sentinel to broadcast to the Bitcoin network.
