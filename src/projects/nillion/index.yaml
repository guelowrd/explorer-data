  Nillion is building Humanity's First Blind Computer – a secure computation and
  storage network that decentralizes trust for high-value data, similar to how
  blockchains decentralize transactions. 


  Nillion's vision is to make it easy for users and developers to leverage
  Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) without being an expert, giving them the
  power to build blind applications in AI, gaming, healthcare, data ownership,
  and beyond.


  Developers can start building today using Nillion’s Python-based DSL, Nada, to
  write programs that handle secret inputs from different users. There are also
  Nada libraries that make it simple to use for developers familiar with NumPy,
  scikit-learn, and PyTorch.
