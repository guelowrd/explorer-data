description: >-
  The Rust-inspired language that makes it easy to build scalable dApps with the
  power of validity proofs. Cairo is the first Turing-complete language for
  creating provable programs for general computation. Cairo lets you write
  provable programs without requiring a deep understanding of the underlying ZK
  concepts. From onchain gaming to provable ML, Cairo makes building trustless
  applications possible.


  Cairo is also the smart-contract language of Starknet, an L2 blockchain that
  is verified over Ethereum.
