  WireMin is a decentralized social network that puts power back in the hands of
  the people, not any central authority. 


  It is built for complete freedom and privacy: no central servers, no metadata
  collection. All messages are end-to-end encrypted and stored on peopleâ€™s
  device so no data could be collected or breached. The network is united by
  peers with equal rights, so no one can monitor the network for surveillance or
  censorship, or for the sale of ads. 


  Features:

  1. Anonymity: No Email/Phone number needed.

  2. Private chat: All messages are end-to-end encrypted, with optional
  self-disappearance

  3. Rich Media: Send files of any size, or long videos

  4. Global Connection: Chat/Feed Spaces, Voice/Video Calls, Large File/Video
  Sharing.

  5. In-app Crypto Wallet: Instant, fee-free crypto transfers with
  self-custodial ID.
