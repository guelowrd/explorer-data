  WireMin is a decentralized social network that puts power back in the hands of
  the people, not a central authority. 


  Built for total freedom and privacy, there are no central servers or metadata
  collection. All messages are end-to-end encrypted and stored on usersâ€™
  devices, ensuring that no data can be collected or breached. The network is
  powered by peers with equal rights, meaning no one can monitor, censor, or
  sell ads on the network.


  Features:

  1. Anonymity: No Email/Phone number needed

  2. Private chat: All messages are end-to-end encrypted, with optional
  self-disappearance

  3. Rich Media: Send files of any size, or long videos

  4. Global Connection: Chat/Feed Spaces, Voice/Video Calls, Large File/Video
  Sharing

  5. In-app Crypto Wallet: Instant, fee-free crypto transfers with
  self-custodial ID
