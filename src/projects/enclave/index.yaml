description: Enclave is an open-source protocol for Encrypted Execution
  Environments (E3) that enables secure, privacy-preserving, and verifiable
  computations on encrypted data using FHE, ZKPs, and DTC (distributed threshold
  cryptography). Use cases include secret voting, sealed-bid auctions, and
  privacy-preserving collaborative analysis that are difficult or impossible
  with traditional solutions.
