description: Succinct is a protocol on Ethereum that proves the world's
  software. It coordinates hardware teams, infrastructure operators, and
  application developers to facilitate the generation of zero knowledge proofs.
  Application developers send programs in normal code that are wrapped with SP1
  to the Succinct Network. This allows the infrastructure layer and hardware
  teams, who we jointly call provers, to compete to generate proofs of the
  programs' execution.
