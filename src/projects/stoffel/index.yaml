description: "Stoffel is a complete privacy runtime framework. Stoffel's
  transformed MPC from theoretical academic papers into deployable code that
  real developers can actually use. The Stoffel stack consists of three powerful
  components: a Python-styled DSL called Stoffel Lang that feels familiar, a
  compiler that transforms your code, and the Stoffel VM that executes it all
  securely."
