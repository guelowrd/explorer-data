description: >-
  Hinkal is an infrastructure company that enables invisible transactions
  on-chain.


  The Hinkal team has built a suite of solutions:


  1) Invisible wallet  â€” enables any on-chain activity without exposing wallet
  data and the history of transactions - releasing next month. 


  2) dApp - proxy for any wallet, enabling invisible transactions without
  changing wallets.


  3) SDK for private payments. Integrated with Request Network  and other
  solutions. 


  Hinkal uses zk, stealth addresses, and TEE under the hood.
