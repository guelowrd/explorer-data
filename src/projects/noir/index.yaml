description: Noir is a language for private and verifiable computing. It enables
  creating succinct proofs of successful program execution. More technically,
  Noir is a Domain Specific Language for SNARK proving systems. It has been
  designed to use any ACIR compatible proving system. Its design choices are
  influenced heavily by Rust and focuses on a simple, familiar syntax.

  - title: NoirCon 0
    description: "This event is set to spotlight Noir, the universal language of
      zero-knowledge designed for two things: writing zero-knowledge (ZK)
      circuits, and smart contracts for the Aztec blockchain.  ​Prepare for a
      deep dive into technical content through expert-led talks, hands-on
      workshops, and discussions. Connect and network with other developers,
      researchers, and privacy advocates."

  - title: NoirCon 1
    description: "Following the success of NoirCon 0 in Bangkok, which featured
      talks from Vitalik and leading privacy researchers, we're bringing the
      community together again in Denver to focus on practical application
      building. Hands-on workshops from teams actively building with Noir,
      including technical deep-dives on AI x privacy applications and real-world
      case studies of privacy-first development.  ​Interactive sessions with the
      broader ZK community, focused on helping developers build actual
      applications—not just theory.  ​Talks and workshops on key topics such as
      (but are not limited to):      ​The State of Privacy for
      Builders      ​zkVMs vs zkDSLs      ​Privacy-Preserving Agents and Models"
