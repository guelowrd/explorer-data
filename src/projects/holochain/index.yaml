description: >
  Holochain is a protocol for local first truly distributed applications that
  have no servers. Holochain applications run on the users' computers. Because
  Holochain is a protocol there is no built in fee for data exchanges between
  Holochain nodes. Just like you donâ€™t pay for using SMTP the email protocol.
  You just use it.

  Apps built on Holochain are infinitely scaleable. Each app brings its own
  resources, compute and storage, and then shares a bit of those resources for
  holographic back up across the network.

  Every Holochain app runs in a private encrypted network. Nobody except the
  users of that specific instance of the app even know it exists. Any hacker or
  government seeing the data stream would not know what it's for.

  Holochain is perfectly suited for DePIN projects beause it doesn't have the
  storage and computational overhead of blockchain. While at the same time
  Holochain apps can work with blockchain projects filling in the gaps where
  blockchain is lacking.
