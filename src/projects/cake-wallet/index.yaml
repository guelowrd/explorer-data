  Cake Wallet was founded in 2018 by Vikrant Sharma, our founder and CEO, with a
  mission

  to expand access to financial privacy for everyone. We started as the first
  Monero wallet

  for iOS, embracing open-source development and self-custody. Since then, we've

  continued to push the boundaries of what's possibleâ€”pioneering the integration
  of

  Bitcoin Silent Payments, Monero background sync, hardware wallets, and
  becoming

  the first mobile app to Feature Litecoin's MWEB privacy network, among many
  other

  cutting-edge privacy and security tools.
